# The code provided seems to be error-free and executable. However, there are some improvements
# that can be made to make the code more readable and maintainable.

# 1. Rename the method `calculate_square` to `get_square` to better reflect its purpose.
# 2. Add docstrings to the classes and methods to provide better documentation.
# 3. Use f-strings for string formatting to improve readability.
# 4. Remove the unnecessary `result` attribute from the Calculator class, as it is not being used.
#    Square calculation can be done directly in the `square` method.
# 5. Move the user input prompt for the integer from the `main` method to the `get_square` method,
#    as it is more logical to get the input from the user in the method that calculates the square.
# 6. Remove the unused calculate_square function.

# Below is the improved version of the code:
